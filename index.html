          <p>I am a creative and ambitious individual. My hobbies have consisted of music, video games, and computer technologies. My family line derives from Cuban and Hispanic branches, and my brother and I are the first of our family to be naturalized United States citizens. I have moved from several states, consisting of Oregon, Washington, Florida, and Texas, through my father's job search in the Information Technology industry. When we had settled in West Linn Oregon for the following 10 years after the fourth grade, I had attended West Linn high school and graduated with my diploma. Immediately after, went to Clackamas Community College to acquire my Associates Degree in general studies.

          <p>I had not chosen a major during that time, I was considerably more lost in what I wanted to study than perhaps the average person of my age. I continued forth onto my bachelor's degree at Portland State University, and at this time, I had moved out of the house to Vancouver Washington to establish a life there. In the first year of my BA, I had felt the same aimlessness I had felt previously upon finishing my AA. Having switched majors at least three times between two of the same subjects, I lost my path at PSU. I continued to work retail for the next year, and thanks to my father, he informed me of the Epicodus classes that are being held in Portland. After realizing that considerably anything else other than retail was worth a fair shot in the position I was in, making litle money and being stagnanted from a career, I did my research on the course and signed up immediately. I knew entering the bootcamp that, in pursuing this new path, I would be pushed in a position to take better care of my well being and change my mindset of education for the benefit of my own stability. </p>
